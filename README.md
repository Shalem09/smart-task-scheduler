# Smart Task Scheduler (Python CLI)

Smart Task Scheduler is a command-line (CLI) application built in Python as a professional learning project.
Its goal is to demonstrate clean Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), proper project structure, and the use of classic design patterns in a real, working system.

The application is designed to be executed **from the terminal only**.

---

## ✨ Key Features
- Task management with priorities
- Task lifecycle states: `BACKLOG`, `READY`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `BLOCKED`, `DONE`
- **State Pattern** – enforces valid state transitions
- **Strategy Pattern** – selects the next task based on priority
- **Rule Engine** – business rules such as overdue detection
- Due dates (`due_date`)
- Task statistics (`stats`)
- JSON-based persistence
- Clean and user-friendly CLI

## ⚠️ Important – How *Not* to Run the Project
❌ Do **NOT** run `cli.py` using the ▶️ (Run) button in VS Code  
❌ Do **NOT** run `python cli.py`

### Why?
- The project is structured as a Python **package**
- It relies on relative imports
- Running it incorrectly will result in `ModuleNotFoundError`

---

## ▶️ Correct Way to Run the Project
The application must be executed from the terminal.

### 1️⃣ Navigate to the `src` directory
```powershell
cd src
```
### 2️⃣ Run using Python module execution
```
python -m scheduler.cli help
python -m scheduler.cli list
```

### 📌 Available CLI Commands
add "<title>" <priority>        Add a new task
list                            List all tasks
next                            Suggest the next task
start <id>                      Move task to IN_PROGRESS
block <id> "<reason>"           Block a task
unblock <id>                    Unblock a task
complete <id>                   Complete a task
due <id> "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM"     Set due date
clear-due <id>                  Remove due date
stats                           Show task statistics
help                            Show help

Design Decisions

dataclasses are used for domain models

State Pattern avoids scattered conditional logic

Rule Engine is separated from CLI and persistence

CLI acts as a thin layer; business logic lives in the Service layer

Execution via python -m follows Python best practices

🚀 Project Purpose

This project was built as a personal portfolio project to:

Strengthen Python OOP skills

Demonstrate clean architecture and design patterns

Serve as a showcase project for Backend / Python roles
